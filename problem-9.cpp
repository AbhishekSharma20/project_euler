/*
* Using pythogarous triplets rule,
* for m>n (this part is very important for later stage)
* a = m^2 -n^2
* b = 2.m.n
* c = m^2 + n^2
* (a,b,c) form pythogarous triplets, i.e => a^2 + b^2 = c^2
* also, a + b + c = 1000 which further reduces the problems to
* m*(m+n) = 500.
* Hence problem reduces to "Find the two factors of 500 which statisfy this relationship. remember  m> n ".
* Answer: (m,n) =(20,5) 
* => (a,b,c) = (375,200,425)
* => a*b*c  = 375*200*425 = 31875000
